      "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\r\n",
      "bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\r\n",
      "the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\r\n",

      "√¢¬Ä¬úwithout pictures or conversations?√¢¬Ä¬ù\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\r\n",
      "hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\r\n",
      "making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\r\n",
      "picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\r\n",
      "close by her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\r\n",
      "so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, √¢¬Ä¬úOh\r\n",
      "dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!√¢¬Ä¬ù (when she thought it over afterwards,\r\n",
      "it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\r\n",
      "time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\r\n",
      "watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\r\n",
      "on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\r\n",
      "had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\r\n",
      "watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\r\n",
      "field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\r\n",
      "large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\r\n",
      "in the world she was to get out again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\r\n",
      "dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\r\n",
      "about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\r\n",
      "deep well.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\r\n",
      "plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\r\n",
      "was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\r\n",
      "what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\r\n",
      "looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\r\n",
      "cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\r\n",
      "hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\r\n",
      "passed; it was labelled √¢¬Ä¬úORANGE MARMALADE√¢¬Ä¬ù, but to her great\r\n",
      "disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\r\n",
      "of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\r\n",
      "cupboards as she fell past it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "√¢¬Ä¬úWell!√¢¬Ä¬ù thought Alice to herself, √¢¬Ä¬úafter such a fall as this, I shall\r\n",
      "think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they√¢¬Ä¬ôll all think me\r\n",
      "at home! Why, I wouldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt say anything about it, even if I fell off the\r\n",
      "top of the house!√¢¬Ä¬ù (Which was very likely true.)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? √¢¬Ä¬úI wonder how\r\n",
      "many miles I√¢¬Ä¬ôve fallen by this time?√¢¬Ä¬ù she said aloud. √¢¬Ä¬úI must be\r\n",
      "getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\r\n",
      "be four thousand miles down, I think√¢¬Ä¬î√¢¬Ä¬ù (for, you see, Alice had learnt\r\n",
      "several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\r\n",
      "though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\r\n",
      "knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\r\n",
      "practice to say it over) √¢¬Ä¬ú√¢¬Ä¬îyes, that√¢¬Ä¬ôs about the right distance√¢¬Ä¬îbut\r\n",
      "then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I√¢¬Ä¬ôve got to?√¢¬Ä¬ù (Alice had no\r\n",
      "idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\r\n",
      "grand words to say.)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Presently she began again. √¢¬Ä¬úI wonder if I shall fall right _through_\r\n",
      "the earth! How funny it√¢¬Ä¬ôll seem to come out among the people that walk\r\n",
      "with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think√¢¬Ä¬î√¢¬Ä¬ù (she was rather\r\n",
      "glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt sound at all\r\n",
      "the right word) √¢¬Ä¬ú√¢¬Ä¬îbut I shall have to ask them what the name of the\r\n",
      "country is, you know. Please, Ma√¢¬Ä¬ôam, is this New Zealand or Australia?√¢¬Ä¬ù\r\n",
      "(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke√¢¬Ä¬îfancy _curtseying_ as you√¢¬Ä¬ôre\r\n",
      "falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) √¢¬Ä¬úAnd what\r\n",
      "an ignorant little girl she√¢¬Ä¬ôll think me for asking! No, it√¢¬Ä¬ôll never do\r\n",
      "to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.√¢¬Ä¬ù\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\r\n",
      "talking again. √¢¬Ä¬úDinah√¢¬Ä¬ôll miss me very much to-night, I should think!√¢¬Ä¬ù\r\n",
      "(Dinah was the cat.) √¢¬Ä¬úI hope they√¢¬Ä¬ôll remember her saucer of milk at\r\n",
      "tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\r\n",
      "no mice in the air, I√¢¬Ä¬ôm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that√¢¬Ä¬ôs\r\n",
      "very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?√¢¬Ä¬ù And here\r\n",
      "Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\r\n",
      "dreamy sort of way, √¢¬Ä¬úDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?√¢¬Ä¬ù and\r\n",
      "sometimes, √¢¬Ä¬úDo bats eat cats?√¢¬Ä¬ù for, you see, as she couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt answer\r\n",
      "either question, it didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt much matter which way she put it. She felt\r\n",
      "that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\r\n",
      "walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\r\n",
      "√¢¬Ä¬úNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?√¢¬Ä¬ù when suddenly,\r\n",
      "thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\r\n",
      "the fall was over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\r\n",
      "she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\r\n",
      "long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\r\n",
      "it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\r\n",
      "and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, √¢¬Ä¬úOh my ears\r\n",
      "and whiskers, how late it√¢¬Ä¬ôs getting!√¢¬Ä¬ù She was close behind it when she\r\n",
      "turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\r\n",
      "herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\r\n",
      "from the roof.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\r\n",
      "Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\r\n",
      "door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\r\n",
      "get out again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\r\n",
      "glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice√¢¬Ä¬ôs\r\n",
      "first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\r\n",
      "but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\r\n",
      "but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\r\n",
      "time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\r\n",
      "behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\r\n",
      "little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\r\n",
      "much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\r\n",
      "passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\r\n",
      "out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\r\n",
      "flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\r\n",
      "through the doorway; √¢¬Ä¬úand even if my head would go through,√¢¬Ä¬ù thought\r\n",
      "poor Alice, √¢¬Ä¬úit would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\r\n",
      "how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only\r\n",
      "knew how to begin.√¢¬Ä¬ù For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\r\n",
      "happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\r\n",
      "indeed were really impossible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\r\n",
      "back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\r\n",
      "any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\r\n",
      "time she found a little bottle on it, (√¢¬Ä¬úwhich certainly was not here\r\n",
      "before,√¢¬Ä¬ù said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\r\n",

      "√¢¬Ä¬úand see whether it√¢¬Ä¬ôs marked √¢¬Ä¬ò_poison_√¢¬Ä¬ô or not√¢¬Ä¬ù; for she had read\r\n",

      "roof off.√¢¬Ä¬ù After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\r\n",

      "√¢¬Ä¬úA barrowful of _what?_√¢¬Ä¬ù thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\r\n",

      "window, and some of them hit her in the face. √¢¬Ä¬úI√¢¬Ä¬ôll put a stop to\r\n",
      "this,√¢¬Ä¬ù she said to herself, and shouted out, √¢¬Ä¬úYou√¢¬Ä¬ôd better not do that\r\n",

      "_some_ change in my size; and as it can√¢¬Ä¬ôt possibly make me larger, it\r\n",
      "must make me smaller, I suppose.√¢¬Ä¬ù\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\r\n",
      "began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get\r\n",
      "through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\r\n",
      "little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,\r\n",
      "was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\r\n",
      "something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\r\n",
      "appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\r\n",
      "safe in a thick wood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "√¢¬Ä¬úThe first thing I√¢¬Ä¬ôve got to do,√¢¬Ä¬ù said Alice to herself, as she\r\n",
      "wandered about in the wood, √¢¬Ä¬úis to grow to my right size again; and the\r\n",
      "second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that\r\n",
      "will be the best plan.√¢¬Ä¬ù\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\r\n",
      "arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\r\n",
      "how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\r\n",
      "the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\r\n",
      "great hurry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\r\n",
      "feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. √¢¬Ä¬úPoor little\r\n",
      "thing!√¢¬Ä¬ù said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\r\n",
      "it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\r\n",
      "might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\r\n",
      "spite of all her coaxing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\r\n",
      "held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\r\n",
      "all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\r\n",
      "and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\r\n",
      "to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\r\n",
      "other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\r\n",
      "over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\r\n",
      "very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\r\n",
      "moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\r\n",
      "the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\r\n",
      "little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\r\n",
      "all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\r\n",
      "its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\r\n",
      "set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,\r\n",
      "and till the puppy√¢¬Ä¬ôs bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "√¢¬Ä¬úAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was!√¢¬Ä¬ù said Alice, as she leant\r\n",
      "against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\r\n",
      "leaves: √¢¬Ä¬úI should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if√¢¬Ä¬îif I√¢¬Ä¬ôd\r\n",
      "only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I√¢¬Ä¬ôd nearly forgotten that\r\n",

      "question is, what?√¢¬Ä¬ù\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\r\n",
      "the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\r\n",
      "looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\r\n",
      "There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\r\n",
      "herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\r\n",
      "behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\r\n",
      "was on the top of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\r\n",

      "caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly\r\n",

      "people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\r\n",
      "other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\r\n",
      "began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground\r\n",
      "in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live\r\n",
      "hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double\r\n",
      "themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\r\n",
      "she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,\r\n",
      "under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she\r\n",
      "had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the\r\n",
      "hedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look\r\n",
      "up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help\r\n",
      "bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was\r\n",
      "going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog\r\n",
      "had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all\r\n",
      "this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\r\n",
      "wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were\r\n",
      "always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice\r\n",
      "soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\r\n",
      "all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time\r\n",
      "the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\r\n",
      "shouting √¢¬Ä¬úOff with his head!√¢¬Ä¬ù or √¢¬Ä¬úOff with her head!√¢¬Ä¬ù about once in a\r\n",
      "minute.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\r\n",
      "dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\r\n",
      "√¢¬Ä¬úand then,√¢¬Ä¬ù thought she, √¢¬Ä¬úwhat would become of me? They√¢¬Ä¬ôre dreadfully\r\n",
      "fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there√¢¬Ä¬ôs any\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\r\n",
      "could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious\r\n",
      "appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after\r\n",
      "watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said\r\n",
      "to herself √¢¬Ä¬úIt√¢¬Ä¬ôs the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\r\n",
      "to.√¢¬Ä¬ù\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "√¢¬Ä¬úHow are you getting on?√¢¬Ä¬ù said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\r\n",
      "enough for it to speak with.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. √¢¬Ä¬úIt√¢¬Ä¬ôs no use\r\n",
      "speaking to it,√¢¬Ä¬ù she thought, √¢¬Ä¬útill its ears have come, or at least one\r\n",
      "of them.√¢¬Ä¬ù In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\r\n",
      "down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\r\n",
      "she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there\r\n",
      "was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "√¢¬Ä¬úI don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think they play at all fairly,√¢¬Ä¬ù Alice began, in rather a\r\n",

      "oneself speak√¢¬Ä¬îand they don√¢¬Ä¬ôt seem to have any rules in particular; at\r\n",
      "least, if there are, nobody attends to them√¢¬Ä¬îand you√¢¬Ä¬ôve no idea how\r\n",
      "confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there√¢¬Ä¬ôs the\r\n",
      "arch I√¢¬Ä¬ôve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\r\n",
      "ground√¢¬Ä¬îand I should have croqueted the Queen√¢¬Ä¬ôs hedgehog just now, only\r\n",

      "√¢¬Ä¬úHow do you like the Queen?√¢¬Ä¬ù said the Cat in a low voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "√¢¬Ä¬úNot at all,√¢¬Ä¬ù said Alice: √¢¬Ä¬úshe√¢¬Ä¬ôs so extremely√¢¬Ä¬î√¢¬Ä¬ù Just then she noticed\r\n",
      "that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\r\n",
